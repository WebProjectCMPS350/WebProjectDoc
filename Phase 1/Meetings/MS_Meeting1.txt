---------------------------------------------------------------------------

$1 In the First Meeting we discussed that we should go through 2 stages:

1- Design:
	To design the project using UML diagrams, then Figma tool.
2- Implement
	To implement the project using HTML, CSS, and JS.

$2 Problems That We'll Ask the Doctor About It:

1- We don't know yet whether we should add a third stage "Deploy" that deploys the website and create a domain to it, We will ask the doctor about it. If the answer is yes, we must remove the WebProjectWebsite repo from the WebProjectCMPS350 Organization and transfer it to a personal repo.

2- We don't know which UML diagram we should implement, all of them? Or just the class diagram?

3- There is a statement in the project description that we didn't understand which is:
" IV. Application design documentation should include the Entities, Repositories and Web API
class diagrams. "

$3 After we asked the doctor these three questions, we will discuss the distribution of the project tasks, and the time for each time (Project Management).
